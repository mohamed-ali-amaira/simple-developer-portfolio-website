      `I've been developing full-stack application since I was 13 years old. I didn't know what full-stack meant at that time because the term was not coined back then. I'm so out of content right now that I'm literally crying writing this text since lorem text is so 2012 now. (will try GPT though)`,
      `After learning HTML and struggling with CSS, I came up with a brilliant idea of using bootstrap so that I don't have to style everything by myself and - for obvious reasons - if you knew bootstrap, you were cool.`,
      `But now, I decided to specialise in building hyper-interactive, blazingly fast and unbelievably responsive Web/Mobile Interfaces, using React/React Native, you could say that I am a react.js enthusiast (thnx facebook for building the best library in the world)`,
